# Official Team Merchandise

Every team member is expected to wear the team T-shirt when representing the team at competition.

For the 2025 season, since we have changed our name and logo, we would like all team members to wear a new shirt and not reuse one from a previous year. To make this easy on everyone, **the team will provide two T-Shirts this year to every team member** so no-one will have an excuse for not wearing the team colors.

We know some team members also like to wear a sweatshirt at competition - particularly at District Championships which can get cold. To make it easy to allow this, while still proudly representing the team, we are offering a sweatshirt and crewneck for sale this year printed in the same markings as the T-Shirt.

This will hopefully allow Team 467 to present a cohesive team appearance and make all of _FIRST_ aware of our new name and logo. Please show your support for the team at competitions by only wearing this official merchandise.

**_Please ignore any minor color variations in the images below - all items will be the same team blue color_**
