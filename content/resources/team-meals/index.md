title: Team Meals
---

Team members eat together as a team during the longer work days of the build season. Most weeks we have Dinner on **Friday** and **Saturday**, however during vacation week and towards the end of the build season, we add meals on other days also.

**We ask that each student contributes to at least one team meal to support the team during the build season.** This is a prerequisite for student participation in our travel competition.

Due to the current size of the team, each meal will be made up of contributions from multiple students.

For more information and to sign up to provide a meal for 2025 season please select a timeslot [here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/409044DADAE2CA6F49-53574065-467build)
