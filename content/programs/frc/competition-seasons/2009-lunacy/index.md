### The Game

_Lunacy_ is a game played on a field known as the CRATER. Two ALLIANCES, one red and one blue, composed of three FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams each, compete in each MATCH. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent by placing the GAME PIECES in the TRAILERS hitched to the opposing ALLIANCEâ€™S ROBOTS.
