title: Start Your Own FIRST Lego League (FLL) Team!
---


**Shrewsbury Robotics will not be running an FLL Program this fall, but we are happy to assist interested parents in starting an FLL team of their own.**

**What is FIRST Lego League:**

FIRST Lego League is a competition program for middle school aged children. Working in small teams students build a robot using Lego EV3 bricks to complete challenges within a 2½ minute match. Students also work together to complete a project based off of a prompt given by FIRST. Every year a theme is set for the competition, the theme is reflected in the year’s robot field as well as the year’s project. There is also a judging component for FIRST’s Core Values which are an integral part of FIRST’s philosophy.

FLL teams teach students important STEM principles, promote collaboration and teamwork, and prepare students for life. If you are interested in starting your own FLL team, Shrewsbury Robotics can assist by loaning NXT bricks, LEGO pieces, providing coaches from the Shrewsbury Robotics Team, and answering questions and providing general guidance.
