One week out from Southern Maine and it's crunch time for 467. We've been working endlessly over the school break to make our robot competition ready.

Our mechanical team has fixed issues with our elevator to ensure it can withstand rapid movement and made minor adjustments to the climber to ensure its consistency. The programming team took control of the robot. They were able to finalize the drive controls and started on automatic scoring alignment to aid driving.  The electrical team mounted and wired up our LEDs which will allow the drive team to communicate and react faster. The impact award presenters are doing mock presentations to mentors and we are finalizing the video submission.

With the establishment of the competition drive controls we were able to start drivers practice to get the candidates familiarized with the controls and have time to practice at our makeshift field set up in the high school commons. We're please to announce and congratulate our drive team members Dillon, Shreyas, Ayesha, Elliot, and Akhil.
