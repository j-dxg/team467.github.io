**_467_** is starting out with a bang. Our team divided into sub teams. For each subteams, there are subsystems. This ensures that the experienced kids are spread out, while the new kids get to learn the ropes. In mechanical engineering, there are a total of six prototyping teams; varying from Deep Climb to Algae mechanisms. Currently, we are saying goodbye to our 2024 season robot: **_Shuffle_**. Our electrical team is stripping all of the wires so we can reuse some of the old mechanisms. Overall, the team is going at twice the speed from last year. This should guarantee us more time to test and learn how to drive the robot!
