Week 2 our sub-groups continue to make improvements. Our mechanical engineering team finished up their CAD on Monday and have been sketching the Algae remover drawing as well as other parts before sending it over to our machining crew, for cutting. We are hoping to get the holes in the belly pan by tonight. Our electrical team is finishing up the schematic and the wiring plan document to ensure our measurements/extensions are up to date. With that, our programming team has started their vision testing and has broken up into sub-teams to finish their projects including coding for LED. We have also started to administer our cross-functional subsystems, having one mechanical lead working with a programming lead. And lastly, we are working on finishing up edits for the website, the 467 videos, and the executive summaries. We would also like to congratulate our Deans List nominees: **Dillon** and **Aamir**.
