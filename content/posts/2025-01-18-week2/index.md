Week 2 is a wrap! Our mechanical subteam finished CADing the robot and is chipping away at making drawings for the manufacturing subteam, which will utilize our knee mill, lathe, and CNC router to machine various parts, the first being the bellypan of the robot. Our electrical team is finishing up the electronics schematic and the wiring plan document to ensure our measurements/extensions are up to date.

Our programming subteam has been compiling the information the mechanical and electrical subteams gave to continue writing code for the competition robot, including implementing vision systems and LEDs.To ensure maximum efficiency, we have also administered cross-functional subsystems, having one mechanical subsystem lead working with a corresponding programming subsystem lead. Lastly, we are working on finishing edits for the website and executive summaries.

We would also like to congratulate our Deanâ€™s List nominees Dillon and Aamir for their outreach and leadership efforts on 467!
