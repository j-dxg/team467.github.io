We are proud to annouce the pilot season of our podcast- Unpacking 467. Led by our 25-26 season hosts Zoe and Dhriti we aim to show you the inner workings of 467 and how we operate during the season. These 45 minute episodes will include a segment on what has happened since the last episode, robot updates, outreach updates, interviews with team leads (varies each episode), and a special topic section based off the episode title which changes each episode. 

We would like to specially thank all members who worked together to plan and create this podcast as it has taken 2 years to complete!
