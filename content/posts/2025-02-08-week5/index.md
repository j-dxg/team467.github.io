It's been 5 weeks since kickoff, and in two weeks we will be at our first competition of the season in Falmouth, Maine! The robot is nearly complete, but some fine-tuning is needed. Both programming and electrical have been working to get the robot moving, although weâ€™ve had occasional mechanical issues, such as with our elevator clutch.

While these setbacks hindered our progress, they progressed our iteration process and forced us to continue making improvements. Machining is complete for our entire robot and the shop is now working to finish our homemade AprilTag mounts and remanufacture parts that needed to be altered. Heading over to our outreach subteam, our Impact presenters are finalizing their script and starting their presentation prep. The rest of our Impact team is hard at work on the proof binder to validate all our presented information. We faced challenges along the way but have persevered and are excited to be back on track. See you next week!
