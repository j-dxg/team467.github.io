This was our final week to work on the robot before our first competition in Southern Maine and team 467 is not stopping.

The mechanical team is working to iron out our climbing mechanism to have a consistent climb, making minor adjustments to the elevator to ensure its consistency for competition, and adjusting the angle of the hopper to ensure that coral won't get jammed between the effector and hopper.

The programming team has been working non stop to perfect our auto align so we can bypass manually lining up for the reef. While our homemade field works well, we took advantage of the WPI practice field (thanks 190) to further test our programming on a full field.  While there we were able to get additional drivers practice and further refine our automatic coral placemnt to ensure consistency. Our impact award presenters did a final practice run through of their presentation to the entire team our impact video submission is complete and has been uploaded.

We are also really excited to announce the name of our robot for Reefscape - **NESSIE**!
