Last weekend, **Team 467** attended our 2nd competition of the year, held on the campus of Western New England University in Springfield, MA.

We had a fantastic event - finishing qualifying matches in 4th place and leading the 3rd Alliance into the elimination round, where we made it to the semifinals before being knocked out.

The fun wasn't over though as we went on to win the **_FIRST_ Impact Award**, described by _FIRST_ as follows: **_The FIRST Impact Award (formerly the Chairman's Award) is the most prestigious award at FIRST, it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the mission of FIRST_** .
