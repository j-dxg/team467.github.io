Weâ€™re already halfway through the build season and our team is moving at a good rate! The shop is continuing to work through the large list of drawings required for all the parts on this robot. While our large industrial machines are crucial to the production of our robots, our 3D printers are equally important, working on smaller elements with filament courtesy of our generous sponsor, Polymaker.

We were able to get some of our key subsystems mounted to the robot and prep the rest for mounting next week. We had a few slip-ups using the wrong length bolts and some interference issues between mechanisms. However, with the help of our captains and team leads, we were able to spot these issues and correct them, crucially ensuring that we wouldn't run into them later on. We are close to handing off the robot to our programming and electrical teams to get the robot up and running. We would like to congratulate our Impact team for finishing the Woodie Flowers and Impact essays. Not only this, but the Impact presentation is close to completion and is nearly ready for its first round of edits!
