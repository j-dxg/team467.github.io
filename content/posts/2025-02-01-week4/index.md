Already halfway through the build season, our team is moving forward. The shop is in full force with the mill, CNC, and lathe manufacturing every part. Our 3D printers working on smaller elements with filaments courtesy of our generous sponsor, Polymaker. We are close to handing off the robot to our programmers and electrical teams to get the robot working. Props also to our Impact Award team, who have finished and submitted the **Woodie Flowers** and **Impact Award** essays. Not only this, but the Impact presentation is close to completion! See you next week.
