Team 467 is committed to spreading STEM to the next generation of engineers. Every year, a group of students from Team 467 visits the elementary schools in the [Shrewsbury Public Schools District](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/) to teach them about the engineering design processâ€”and our robot **_SHUFFLE_**.

We kicked off our presentations at [Spring Street School](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/spring). The kids were very interested in learning about the process we use to build our robots. It was also a way to show off **_SHUFFLE_**, our 2024 robot! Our presentation included the design process that we use to bring our concepts to reality, a demonstration of our robot, and even a little quiz about the parts in our robot! Overall, this is a great way to spread STEM awareness and help gain support for our team.
