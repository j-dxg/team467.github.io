Shrewsbury Robotics has come to the end of our 2024/25 **_FIRST_ LEGO League** season. We have had a great year mentoring teams for **Shrewsbury Public Schools** and are very pleased with how much they have achieved especially for what is their rookie year for most of them.

We started with 16 teams comprised of 5th-8th grade students, in general 5/6 students on a team. Each team was coached by parent volunteers who in turn were mentored by High School **_FIRST_ Robotics** team members and mentors. We helped the teams by teaching how to use the new Spike LEGO kits, assistance with building robots and developing projects. In addition, we provided the teams with 2 mock competitions that included full judging sessions.

During the qualifiers, 8 teams won awards and 8 teams received invitations to the State Championship at WPI. Some of the teams won both, others only one or the other. We are happy to say that 2 of those teams who went to the State Championship also won awards there.

The hard work of these teams and their coaches was evident at all events. We are extremely proud of all of them and hope to see them next year either at FIRST LEGO League or for the current 8th graders as Shrewsbury High School Robotics teams members (FRC 467).

Thank you to everyone who has helped make this yearâ€™s program a success.
