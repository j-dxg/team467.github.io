Itâ€™s week 3, and our three sub-teams are on a roll! The CAD team has finished designs for the overall robot, while drawings have been sent to the machining team, who are diligently working on the mill, lathe, and CNC router. Electrical has been busy finishing up their schematics as well as preparing to take measurements. Meanwhile, programming has nearly completed the vision code and is beginning work on autonomous. Finally, our outreach team has practically finished the **Impact Award** and **Woodie Flowers** essays while footage for our Impact Award video is also being filmed. Overall we are making great progress, and are well on our way to having a completed robot for our Southern Maine competition!
