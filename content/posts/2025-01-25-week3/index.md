It’s week 3, and our three main sub-teams are on a roll! Our manufacturing team is working as quickly as possible to machine parts based on the drawings they’ve been given. While the CAD team is finally slowing down after two weeks of hard work, they are still diligent in finalizing smaller details. Mechanical is beginning to piece together each subsystem, primarily focusing on the drivetrain. The students note any improvements needed for each mechanism and relay them back to CAD. Electrical has been busy finishing their schematics and preparing to take cable measurements. They are also coordinating with mechanical to ensure enough space for all electrical components, primarily on the bellypan.

Meanwhile, programming has nearly completed the vision code and is beginning work on autonomous. Finally, our outreach team has practically finished the Impact Award and Woodie Flowers’ essays and is filming footage for our Impact Award video. Overall we are making great progress, and are well on our way to having a completed robot for our Southern Maine competition!
