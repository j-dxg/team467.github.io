For over a decade, _FIRST_ Robotics Team 467 has been known as the **Colonials**, aligning with the historic sports team name used by our home at **Shrewsbury High School**.  This name has served us well, however we've felt for some time that it didn't perfectly fit our robotics team, or align with the naming style adopted by other _FIRST_ teams, many of whom have selected names that are derived from well known math, engineering or science concepts.

This year, the name **CENTER OF MASS** was proposed as our new name and immediately felt right on multiple fronts:

- It is a fun, STEM themed name
- It describes our location in Central Massachusetts
- It is unique and not currently in use by any other _FIRST_ Robotics teams.

Along with this change in name, we're retiring our old 467 Logo and its subtle reference to the Colonial Tricorn hat in favor of a new logo that better aligns with our new name.

We're looking forward to trying on our new name and logo for the first time as we compete in the 2025 competition season.
