FRC Team 467, Colonials will be showing our robot **_SHUFFLE_** at the [Spirit of Shrewsbury]({{< ref "/events/spirit-of-shrewsbury" >}}) this year.

**_SHUFFLE_** is our competition robot from the 2024 FIRST Robotics Game - [Crescendo]({{< ref "/programs/frc/competition-seasons/2024-crescendo" >}}) which won a place in the New England District Championship.

We will be at both the Town Expo on Saturday, Sept 28 and the Parade on Sunday, Sept 29.
