Fall, along with a myriad of vibrant hues, also brings us the Shrewsbury Robotics Open House. This year, it will be held on **Saturday November 9th from 1:00-4:00 p.m.**

The highlight of the day will be the shop tour which includes introducing the newest addition to our manufacturing capability, our new **Shop Sabre CNC** table.

We will also have STEM based activities for Elementary and Middle School kids! Various stations will explain parts of our robot design - how is a robot controlled? What does it use to move around so fluidly? How can it pick game pieces up off the ground and fling them across the room?

The afternoon will also have:
- Robot Demos
- Pie Ticket Sales (pies baked and ready for pickup on 11/23)
- Apparel pre-orders
- Light refreshments
