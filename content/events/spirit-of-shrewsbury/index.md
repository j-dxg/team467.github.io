title: Spirit of Shrewsbury Fall Festival
---

Every year as the leaves change color, Team 467 attends the Annual [Spirit of Shrewsbury](https://www.shrewsburyfallfestival.org/) (S.O.S.) Fall Festival. This festival allows members of the Shrewsbury community to enjoy and learn about many of the townâ€™s schools, clubs and organization. Our team has attended and participated since our founding, allowing the local community to learn about the team and for us to spread the message of [_FIRST_](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) and [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics).

This event is extremely important to us. Our students enjoy sharing their experience on _FIRST_ Team 467 with the public and showing off the robots they have built. It gives us an opportunity to connect with our sponsors and supporters and share the impact of our program with a wider audience.

We participate in two events during this festival. On Saturday, we have a booth in the local expo, where we showcase our robots, talk to parents and students about our **_FIRST_ Robotics** and **_FIRST_ Lego League** programs and provide an opportunity for our FLL teams to share their projects that are in development. During the expo our students are also interviewed for the local TV station.

On the Sunday of the festival, our students and robots march in the parade along with many other local organizations. Many team members tell us that their first interest in robotics was formed as a young child, watching the robot in the parade.

Join us for a great weekend as we share the fun and enthusiasm we have for Shrewsbury Robotics, and help build a passion for science, technology and engineering in the next generation of students.
